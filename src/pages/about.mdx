I’m a research scientist
working to better understand how neural activity motivates and shapes human
behavior.

My expertise includes project design and management, data analysis
and interpretation, and the development and implementation of research
tools.

I enjoy generating new ideas and devising feasible solutions to
broadly relevant problems.

My colleagues would describe me as a driven,
resourceful individual who maintains a positive, proactive attitude when
faced with adversity.

Currently, I’m seeking opportunities that will allow
me to develop and promote technologies that benefit human health. Specific
fields of interest include data analytics, biotechnology, and
pharmaceuticals.

I'm a multi-talented human. Most of my time I design and build digital products. You can also call me a product designer, experience designer, interaction, UI, UX or by any other market defined function-title. I'm also a multi-disciplinary maker with over 9 years of experiences in wide range of design disciplines, manager, advisor, entrepreneur, front-end developer, music enthusiast, traveler, photographer and more.

Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer nearly 8 years ago, I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.
