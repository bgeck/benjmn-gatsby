I'm a coder, designer, and artist living and working in Austin, Texas. I fuse technology and art to create experiences that engage people on a deep level and delight them in unexpected ways.

Currently, I've been diving into VR, AR, and machine learning, looking for cool and innovative applications and expressions of these new mediums.
