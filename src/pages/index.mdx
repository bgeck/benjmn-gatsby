# What I do!

I’m a research scientist
working to better understand how neural activity motivates and shapes human
behavior.

My expertise includes project design and management, data analysis
and interpretation, and the development and implementation of research
tools.

I enjoy generating new ideas and devising feasible solutions to
broadly relevant problems.

My colleagues would describe me as a driven,
resourceful individual who maintains a positive, proactive attitude when
faced with adversity.

Currently, I’m seeking opportunities that will allow
me to develop and promote technologies that benefit human health. Specific
fields of interest include data analytics, biotechnology, and
pharmaceuticals.
